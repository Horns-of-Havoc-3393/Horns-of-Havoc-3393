                    <h1>What We Do</h1>
                    <p>We design, build, and program robots to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Our team collaborates on engineering challenges, develops coding skills, and participates in community outreach to promote STEM education. Our club provides an excellent opportunity for students to practice essential networking skills that would motivate individual success. Students have an opportunity to build robots for FRC or FTC, both offer unique challenges and learning experiences that is beneficial to development of critical thinking skills</p>

                    <h1>A little more about us</h1>
                    <p>We officially formed Team 3393 Horns of Havoc just two weeks before the 2010 kickoff. Although we registered in October, our first meetings didn’t start until December when enough students showed interest. We began with about ten students and four mentors. By mid-season, our team had settled to six dedicated members, which let each of us contribute fully. With strong support from our sponsor team 2557, we made it to the Seattle Regional and advanced to the quarterfinals as a first-round pick in the finals. In 2011, we joined the Tacoma Robotics Alliance alongside teams 2557 SotaBots and rookie 3781 PennyBots. This partnership gave us access to a replica game field and welcomed new members and mentors to our team. Competing in the Microsoft Seattle Olympic Regional, we finished qualifying matches with a 9-1 record and set the regional high score of 66 points. Seeded second, we formed a final alliance with teams 2990 and 1899. Together, we stayed undefeated through eliminations, won the regional, and advanced to the championship in St. Louis.</p>

                    <h1>Earn Volunteer Hours</h1>
                    When you join robotics you can earn all 20 hours of volunteer service within the school year. We provide various opportunities to earn volunteer hours while helping grow STEM in our community. We offer opportunities for you to earn volunteer hours through STEM outreach events, demonstrations at facilities such as the state fair, the Glass Mueseum, and Elementary schools.

From events like a 2-hour shift for the state fair demo(you can do more), 1 STEM nights at an elementary school, and fundraising efforts alone can earn you at least 10 hours of volunteer service.
